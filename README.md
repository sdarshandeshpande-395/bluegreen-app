🚀 Blue-Green CI/CD Deployment using Jenkins, Docker & Kubernete

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a Production-Ready Blue-Green Deployment Strategy implemented using:

🔹 Jenkins – CI/CD automation

🔹 Docker – Containerization

🔹 Kubernetes – Container orchestration

🔹 GitHub – Source code management

The objective is to achieve Zero Downtime Deployment while releasing new application versions.

🔄 How Blue-Green Deployment Works 🔵 Blue Environment

Currently serving production traffic

Stable version

🟢 Green Environment

New version deployed

Tested before going live

Traffic Switching

Kubernetes Service selector updates:

selector: version: green

Traffic shifts instantly from Blue → Green without downtime.

⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline Flow Developer Push ↓ Jenkins Build ↓ Docker Image Build ↓ Push to Docker Hub ↓ Deploy Green in Kubernetes ↓ Switch Service Traffic

🌐 Application Output 🔵 Version 1 – Blue Environment Version 1 - Blue Environment

🟢 Version 2 – Green Environment Version 2 - Green Environment

Users experience zero downtime during switching.

🛠 Technologies Used Tool Purpose Jenkins CI/CD Automation Docker Containerization Kubernetes Deployment & Traffic Switching GitHub Source Code Management 🔁 Rollback Strategy

If the Green deployment fails:

kubectl patch service my-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"blue"}}}'

Traffic immediately switches back to Blue.

🎯 Key Features

✔ Zero Downtime Deployment ✔ Instant Rollback ✔ Automated CI/CD Pipeline ✔ Production-Ready Strategy ✔ Scalable Infrastructure

📊 Real-World Relevance
